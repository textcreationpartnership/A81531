            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N ancient times have I read of Propheteſſes, but not untill of late heard of women Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, their onely reaſon or cauſe of preaching was, that there was a deficiency of good men, wherefore it was but fit, that vertuous women ſhould ſupply their places, they were (men they did mean) good for nothing, but to make their texts good by expounding the language of the Beaſt, but they themſelves would preach nothing, but ſuch things as the ſpirit ſhould move them.</p>
            <p>The firſt and chief of this female and Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall function, was one <hi>Anne Hempſtall,</hi> living in the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Andrews Holborne,</hi> neere <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, ſhe having a minde, ſaid ſhee was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be zealouſly affected, called an aſſembly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:156979:3"/>of her bibbing Goſſips together, whoſe thoughts were bent more upon the ſtrong water bottle, then upon the uſes or doctrines which their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſiſter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntended to expound unto them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the houſe of this <hi>Anne Hempſtall,</hi> zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Nan</hi> ſpake to them after this manner.</p>
            <p>Beloved ſiſters, this laſt night I dreamed a ſtrange Dream, moreover me thought I ſaw a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in which <hi>Anna</hi> the Proheteſſe was preſented unto my view, the ſplendour of whoſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance did caſt me into a trance, wherein I lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the next morning, and the morning being come, I could conceive no interpretation of my Dream but this, that I ſhould imitate godly <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> by preaching unto you, as ſhee propheſied to others, her ſpeech ſtrook them all into an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, at which, this prophane <hi>Anne</hi> cryed out, Now doth the holy Ghoſt deſcend downe upon you, Wherefore give eare unto mee, then did ſhe begin to talke, and ſpeak unto them that which firſt came into her minde, but the chiefe matter of her Text was this, That womans haire was an adorning to her, but for a man to have long haire, it was a ſhame unto him, which the Scripture it ſelfe cryed fie upon; long did ſhee preach, and longer I dare avouch then ſome of the audience were willing, for ſome of them had as far home as White Chappell, wherefore her longitude might cauſe a brevitude of her ſucking the <hi>Aquavitae</hi> bottle; two houres being expired, and the bottom of the ſtool beginning to look o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen-mouthed with her furious ſtamps, ſhee gave
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156979:3"/>them as much peace as in her lay, and ſo conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary Bilbrowe,</hi> one of the audience, being of the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields, deſired them to be all with her the next morning, and after Sermon, they ſhould have a good fat pig to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, beſides a cup of Sack or Claret to waſh it down, they all agreed unto it, and making uſe of all the Rhetorick which they were borne unto, they gave her thanks, and ſo for that time a Bottle of Ale or two being devoured, they departed every one to their owne houſes. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they met altogether at the houſe of <hi>Mary Bilbrow,</hi> whoſe husband was a good honeſt Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layer, and ſo ſoon as they came within the doores of her houſe, ſhee brought them all into her Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour as ſhee called it, and inſteed of ſtools and cuſhions, ſhee had provided before hand, three bricks a piece for them to ſit upon, her reaſon was this, ſhee thought they would not fit much, becauſe women to good inſtructions love ſtanding, her Pulpit was framed very ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of brick, ſo high, that ſcarce any thing, but her ſtanding up tippet could be ſeen, ſhe began there very devoutly to make an <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayer, but before ſhee had ſcarce ſpoke twenty words, her daughter came running in very haſtily, telling her a Gentleman at <hi>Bloomsbury</hi> ſtaid to ſpeake with her about urgent occaſions, which hearing, ſhee lept out of her prayer into this ſerious meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I think it be the Gentleman I was withall at <hi>Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:156979:4"/>Court, whom I promiſed this day to meet with all, whereupon ſhee left her Pulpit, ſpread the cloth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd brought her Goſſips in a pig accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her promiſe, who fed heartily, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, ſo much at this time for <hi>Middleſex</hi> female Teachers.</p>
            <p>Now give mee leave to take water, and goe to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and ſo further into <hi>Kent,</hi> where I ſhall tell you of one <hi>Joan Bauford</hi> in the Town of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſham,</hi> who taught in <hi>Feverſham,</hi> that husbands being ſuch as croſſed their wives wils might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be forſaken.</p>
            <p>Then was there one <hi>Suſan May</hi> of <hi>Aſhford</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent</hi> alſo which preached in a Barne there, that the Devill was the father of the Pope, The Pope the father of thoſe which did weare Surplices, wherefore conſequently the Devill was the Father of all thoſe which did not love Puritans.</p>
            <p>There was likewiſe one <hi>Elizabeth Bancroft</hi> in <hi>Ely</hi> in <hi>Cambridgſhire,</hi> where Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> firſt going to place Altars there, preached behind the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon a Saturday, that it was fit upon Sunday to Sacrifice the Popes Bird upon his own Altar.</p>
            <p>Then laſtly there was one <hi>Arabella Thomas</hi> a Welch woman, which lived in the City of <hi>Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which preached, and in her Sermon ſaid that none but ſuch painfull creatures as her ſelfe ſhould goe to Heaven, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thoſe Miniſters which did not preach twice upon every Sabbath day, ſhee ſaid that very ſhortly the black Raven by day, and the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156979:4"/>white Owle by night ſhould ſcratch out their eyes.</p>
            <p>Thus have I declared ſome of the female Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, but where their Vniverſity is I cannot tell, but I ſuppoſe that Bedlam or Bridewell would be two convenient places for them, is it not ſufficient that they may have the Goſpell truly and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preached unto them, but that they muſt take their Miniſters office from them? if there had been ſuch a dearth of the Goſpell as there was in the Reigne of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> it had beene an occaſion ſome what urgent, But God bee pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it was not ſo, but that they ſeemed to bee ambitious, and becauſe they would have ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they would get upon a ſtoole, or in a tubb in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of a pulpit. At this time I have deſcribed but ſix of them, ere long I feare I ſhall relate more, I pray God I have no cauſe, and ſo for this time I conclude.</p>
